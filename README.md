# SpacemanGame

ToDo:
X Take text input for mystery word.
X Take character input as guesses to mystery word.
    Should I add a delay so the char is visible in the text box?
X Create display showing the number of characters in mystery word as empty spaces.
X Display incorrect guesses somewhere on the page.
X Display correct guesses in the appropriate spot in the display which will dynamically update.
X Countdown variable to auto update after incorrect guesses.
X Game end events to happen automatically after countdown elapses or word completed.
Make modal for instructions to appear on load. Will eventually also hold the beginning of games options.

Stretch Goals
Small, static image built as the countdown variable increments.
Choose and incorporate font
Player choice on how many turns before end of game.
Make functions, so code is nicer
At the beginning of a road, select the option to enter a word or phrase with spaces.
Create pun name.
Display timer.
Allow punctuation.
Choice at beginning - easy or hard mode, showing punctuation or not showing it.
Incorporate a dictionary API to ensure words are actual words.
Create spell check function using API.
Create a hint function to appear after certain number consecutive incorrect guesses.
Be able to select auto-play, so the computer chooses the mystery word for the player to guess.
Save timed results and display session history.
Parse timed results by difficulty/char length to make the data more comparable.
