# SpacemanGame

ToDo:  
X Take text input for mystery word.  
X Take character input as guesses to mystery word.  
-Should I add a delay so the char is visible in the text box?  
X Create display showing the number of characters in mystery word as empty spaces.  
X Display incorrect guesses somewhere on the page.  
X Display correct guesses in the appropriate spot in the display which will dynamically update.  
X Countdown variable to auto update after incorrect guesses.  
X Game end events to happen automatically after countdown elapses or word completed.  
X Make modal for instructions to appear on load. Will eventually also hold the beginning of games options.  
X Find way to stop already guessed letters from counting  

Stretch Goals:  
X Be able to select auto-play, so the computer chooses the mystery word for the player to guess.  
X Display timer (TODO - how to get the increments every 1s to update on the DOM?).  
X Small, static image builds as the countdown variable increments.  
X Choose and incorporate font.  
X Player choice on how many turns before end of game.  
Make functions, so code is nicer.  
At the beginning of a round, select the option to enter a word or phrase with spaces.   
X Pull random word API for bot play.  
Create a hint function to appear after certain number consecutive incorrect guesses.  
Decorate the liftoff counter with colored text, background div, etc.  
X Download gif of image to make the rocket have movement.  
Save timed results and display session history.  
Parse timed results by difficulty/char length to make the data more comparable.  
Other design aesthetics?
